# CMS 484 Capstone Project

## Team

Ben Mann, Noah Harvey, Fritz Stapfer Paz

## Overview (Elevator Pitch)

The goal of this project is to develop a framework to accelerate mobile app development within the Unity Game Engine using C#. Our mindset is that by developing a well-architecture collection of all the reusable codes for simple video-games, we will be able to speed up subsequent development of games. This project will include the documentation, architectural diagrams, codes, and videogames resulting from our development.
